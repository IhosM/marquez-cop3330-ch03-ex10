/*Write a program that takes an operation followed by two operands and
outputs the answerult. For example:
+ 100 3.14
* 4 5
 Read the operation into a string called operation and use an
if-statement to figure out which operation the user wants, for example,
if (operation=="+"). Read the operands into variables of type double.
Implement this for operations called +, â€“, *, /, plus, minus, mul, and div
with their obvious meanings
